# RPG Game: Dungeon Crawler Adventure

The RPG Game is a text-based dungeon crawler developed in Python, simulating a classic role-playing game experience through a command-line interface. Players navigate through procedurally generated rooms, encounter various enemies, and make strategic decisions to progress towards the final room, aiming for eternal fame and glory.

This project demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create a modular, maintainable, and extendable game architecture. It also incorporates unit tests to ensure the reliability of game mechanics, including player actions, enemy behavior, room generation, and inventory management, showcasing professional software engineering practices.
